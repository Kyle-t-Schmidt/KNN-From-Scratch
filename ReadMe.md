# KNN Classifier

This project is still in work and not a functioning program yet. The program, 
when finished will allow a user to implement a K nearest neighbors
classification using csv files. The program is being written in Python and will
only use the Numpy package in addition to base Python functions. The reason 
for only using numpy is to ensure the program runs quickly and for my own
educational purposes.
